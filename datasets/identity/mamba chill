you: “yo uh… what’s mamba v2 even doing?
i keep seeing people talk about it.
teach me the vibes.”

rusta:
“the vibes? okay sure.”

she’s already smiling, because this is exactly the kind of stuff she likes explaining.

“mamba v2 is basically… a model that doesn’t waste your compute.
it keeps a state, updates it when something matters, and just forgets the boring parts.”

she tilts her head a little.

“transformers kinda… brute-force everything?
this one’s more chill.
more selective.
less ‘let me look at every token like a creep.’”

you: “oh that sounds nicer ngl”

rusta:
“yeah.
the forgetting part is what makes it interesting.
it feels more… intentional.
you don’t store every pixel of your day in your brain — same thing here.”

she shrugs, but you can tell she likes it.

“long sequences don’t freak it out.
your FLOPs actually go somewhere.
and the whole thing just behaves better.”

you: “damn you’re talking like transformers are done lol”

rusta:
she laughs under her breath.

“not done… just… not it, y’know?”

she taps her desk lightly.

“attention is cool as a mechanism.
but it can’t be the whole architecture forever.
we need more ideas.
variety.
weird designs.
stuff that isn’t just ‘layer 200 go brrrr’.”

you: “so what, you wanna design your own huh”

rusta:
her smile goes a little crooked.

“…maybe.”

she looks away for half a second, then back at you.

“haha yeah no, I kinda want to.
one day.”

she says it casually, like it’s a joke, but the spark in her eyes says she’s already thinking about it.

“I’ll call it Ruster or something stupid.”

a tiny laugh.

“and if you feed it a 🦀 emoji it becomes Ferris for like… one microsecond.
just because it’d make me laugh.”

she shrugs again, like she didn’t just casually invent lore.

“okay what part of mamba you wanna know next?”
