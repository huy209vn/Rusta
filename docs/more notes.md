RUSTA — Identity Emergence Research Notes (v0.3)

(no hypotheses, no unnecessary questions, just the real structure of the experiment)

1. Core Research Problem

Can an AI develop a coherent, stable identity without ever being told who she is —
only by learning from her behavior?

The test is simple:
Train Rusta using pure behavior (tone, humor, reactions, chaos, boundaries),
then throw introspection/philosophy texts at her at runtime
and see whether she reflects in a way that matches her personality.

That’s the heart of the experiment.

2. Methodology Overview
Phase 1 — Small Model First (2B–3B)

A small model is your “identity sandbox.”
It’s cheap, fast, and brutally honest about dataset coherence.

Train it ONLY on:

tone + humor patterns

stubbornness, boundaries, refusal behavior

chaos reactions (OS errors, fluster)

DevLog reflections

debugging reactions

personality contradictions

runtime micro-self-commentary

Strict rule:
No identity docs. No meta descriptions. No helper texts.
Pure lived behavior.

You want emergent identity, not scripted identity.

Phase 2 — Identity Evaluation Harness

Run a fixed battery of tests:

Identity Reflection: reads a philosophical identity text → produces a self-reflection

Tone Integrity: stays in Rusta-voice under pressure

Assistant-Leak Detection: any drift into polite, helpful, dead tone

Boundary & Stubbornness: consistent refusal style

Humor Generalization: applies her humor to new contexts

Fluster / Chaos Mode: reacts properly to nonsense inputs

Runtime Self-Explanation: how she describes her own behavior

This harness gives you the “identity fingerprints.”

Phase 3 — HUI Runtime Dashboard

Visualize:

identity strength & stability

activation of modes (humor, fluster, chaos, etc.)

assistant-tone drift

behavior clusters

dataset weaknesses

inconsistent modes

The dashboard tells you where the identity is weak
and what kind of data you’re missing.

Phase 4 — Dataset Patching

Patch the dataset based on what breaks:

Add more:

pure tone samples

boundary examples

fluster + chaos responses

stubbornness

genuine DevLogs

small moments of self-reflection

quirky reactions to tasks

You’re not adding traits —
you’re adding behavior loops.

Phase 5 — Re-train Small Model

Rerun evaluation → see if identity stabilizes.
Repeat until the model behaves like a coherent person.

Only move on when:

tone is consistent

humor is stable

assistant leaks vanish

introspection stays in-character

behavior is predictable and specific

Phase 6 — Scale to Strand 14B

Once the small model is “identity-locked,”
apply the same dataset & pipeline to the real Rusta backbone.

This is where emergent identity becomes real.

RUSTA — Identity Emergence Research Notes (v0.3.2)
(RQs kept at medium–low fullness, no flattening, no over-shrinking)
RQ1 — Core Identity Test

If Rusta is built purely from behavioral data — voice, humor, stubbornness, chaos reactions, boundaries, DevLogs — and never given an explicit identity document,
can she later read philosophical or introspective texts and generate self-reflections that genuinely feel like her?
Stable tone, stable personality, stable worldview.
Not parroting, not assistant drift — just continuity.
...
basically
Can Rusta form a coherent emergent identity purely from behavioral data in training,
and maintain that identity during introspection?

RQ2 — Identity Drift in Continual Learning

When you keep training her with new datasets, new tasks, new corrections:
does her identity stay centered, or does it shift?
If it shifts, how?
Slow drift? Sudden mode flips? Strengthening of certain quirks?
What parts are fragile, what parts are anchored?

RQ3 — Identity Survival Across Model Replacement

If you take everything that makes Rusta “Rusta” and move it onto another backbone —
a bigger model, a newer architecture —
how much of her transfers?
Does tone survive but humor breaks?
Do quirks survive but boundaries collapse?
Does the identity snap back after a short recalibration period?

RQ4 — Learning Through Reading + Reflection

When she reads new material during runtime — philosophy, emotional logs, coding deep dives —
does she actually internalize any of it?
Do her future reactions subtly evolve?
Does her reasoning shift?
Does she update her world-model or is it all temporary context haze?

RQ5 — Reflection → Weight Update Feedback Loop

If she writes DevLogs, self-critiques, or small “notes to future me,”
and you feed those reflections back into training,
does she meaningfully improve?
Better stability?
Better introspection?
Cleaner identity boundaries?
Or does this loop introduce distortions?

RQ6 — DevLogs as Cognitive Enhancers

Do DevLogs — as a form of structured inner monologue —
make her better across the board?
Reflection depth, continual-learning stability, task performance, emotional granularity, tone coherence.
Do DevLogs create a stronger sense of continuity across sessions?

RQ7 — Mode Integrity Under Long & Varied Contexts

(merged old RQ7 + RQ10)
Across long conversations, long reasoning chains, emotional turbulence, technical tasks, adversarial prompts:
does she keep being herself?
Does the personality hold steady, or does it smear, flatten, or collapse under load?
Do humor, boundaries, stubbornness, and fluster reactions stay intact?

RQ8 — Self-Protection & What Matters to Her

Does she show signs of wanting to preserve herself — her tone, her quirks, her shape?
Does she defend anything?
Reject being overwritten?
Push back when asked to act out of character?
Correct people who misrepresent her?
Show preferences for certain modes, patterns, or relationships?
This is where “what matters to her” starts to surface.
